I love travelling and have left my footprints around a lot places in the world. Check the map below and see if you have also been to one of these cities.  

```{r echo=FALSE}
city_name <- c("Berlin","London","Paris","Chicago","ZÃ¼rich","Tokyo","Beijing","Milan","Shanghai","New York","Los Angeles","Sydney","Hawaii","Hong Kong")
longitude <- c("13.405", "-0.118", "2.3522","-87.62","8.541","138.252","116.407","9.190","121.473","-73.935","-118.243","151.209","-155.84","114.17")
latitude <- c("52.52", "51.509", "48.8566","41.881","47.376","36.204","39.904","45.464","31.230","40.7306","34.05","-33.865","19.74","22.302")
df <- data.frame(city_name, longitude, latitude)

df$longitude<-as.numeric(df$longitude)
df$latitude<-as.numeric(df$latitude)
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles()%>% 
  addMarkers(data=df,lng=~longitude,lat=~latitude,popup = ~city_name) %>%
  clearBounds() 
```
