<div class="a"> Much of my research has focused on understanding the nature of human cognition and behaviour. I have received training in numerous fields (e.g., economics, psychology, anthroplogy, and political science) and firmly believes an interdisciplinary approach towards scientific inquiry. My interest is initially grounded in dual-process reasoning theory but has gradually shifted to the evolution of psychological systems, with a special emphasis on biases in cognition, social learning, and gene-culture coevolution. I am eager to apply my research in the business world and drive positive changes.

I graduated from the [LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) with a BSc in Government and Economics in 2018. During my three years in London, I had the privilege of working under [Dr. Heather Kappes](https://www.lse.ac.uk/management/people/academic-staff/hkappes) and obtained excellent research training in behaviourial science. A year later, I completed my M.A. in Social Sciences at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), where I investigated algorithms and human information avoidance under the supervision of [Dr. Berkeley Dietvorst](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/berkeley-dietvorst). I also had the pleasure of investigating how leadership decisions differ across cultures with [Professor. Todd Hare](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/faculty/hare.html) in Zurich.
