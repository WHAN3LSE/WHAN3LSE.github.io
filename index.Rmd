<div class="a"> Much of my research has focused on understanding the nature of human cognition and behaviour. I have background in numerous academic fields (e.g., psychology, economics, neuroscience, and behavioural ecology) and firmly believe in an interdisciplinary approach towards scientific inquiry. My interest was initially grounded in dual-process reasoning theory but gradually shifted to the evolution of psychological systems, with a special emphasis on biases in cognition, social learning, and gene-culture coevolution. I am eager to apply my research in the real world and drive positive changes.
