<div class="a"> Much of my research has focused on understanding the nature of human cognition and behaviour. I have received training in numerous domains (e.g. economics, psychology, anthroplogy, and political science) and follows an interdisciplinary approach to scientific inquiry. My interest is initially grounded in dual-process reasoning theory but has gradually shifted to the evolution of psychological systems, with a special emphasis on biases in cognition, social learning, and gene-culture coevolution. I also possess experience in public policy analysis and am eager to apply my training to help political entities make better decisions.

I graduated from the [LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) with a BSc in Government and Economics in 2018. A year after, I obtained my M.A in Social Sciences at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), where I investigated algorithms and human information avoidance under the supervision of [Dr. Berkeley Dietvorst](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/berkeley-dietvorst).
