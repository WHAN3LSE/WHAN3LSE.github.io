<div class="a"> Much of my research has focused on understanding how emerging technologies influence consumer psychology and behaviour. A second stream of my work focuses on the evolutionary mechanisms of human behaviour.

As a firm believer in interdisciplinary research, I have received training in numerous scientific fields (e.g., economics, psychology, geography). 

I am also eager to apply my work in real world and drive positive changes.
